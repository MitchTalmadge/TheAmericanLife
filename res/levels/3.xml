            <topText>The former business man brought home an injured and forever scarred soul.</topText>
            <topText>Thomas may have lost a leg in the war, but his physical injuries couldn't compare to the mental insanity</topText>

            <topText>What he cared about most was his family, but something had changed after those two horrible years.</topText>
            <topText>His wife was upset, she believed nothing good came from that war, and was struggling to get food on the table.</topText>
            <topText> </topText>
            <topText>Thomas' kids also changed drastically.</topText>
            <topText>Every day for the past two years, they had no father to meet at the door after he returned home from work.</topText>
            <topText>He was gone, and it was unknown when, or even if he would come back.</topText>

            <topText>When he finally arrived home, his children were shocked.</topText>
            <topText>They stared at a man who they did not recognize.</topText>
            <topText>They saw a broken man, no longer the father they once knew.</topText>
